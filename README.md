#  Flowcus bar

Flowcus bar is a pomodoro-like app, it shows a progress bar always on top of any window, so you get constant feedback of how much time left you have. 

The goal is to help you focus and etner flow state, additionally has an option for screen capturing your senssions for self accoutability and helping with context switching, so you can check where did you left last time you worked and review what did you do.

It helps with time blindness and time percepcion, you can set the timer to 5 minutes and watch the bar progressing, you'l realise that actually 5 minutes is a lot.
