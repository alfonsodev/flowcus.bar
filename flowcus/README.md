## Order a dictionary

```
You can't sort a dictionary but you can sort its keys and loop through them as follow:

let myDictionary = ["name1" : "Loy", "name2" : "Roy", "name3" : "Tim", "name4" : "Steve"]   // ["name1": "Loy", "name2": "Roy", "name3": "Tim", "name4": "Steve"]


let sorted = myDictionary.sorted {$0.key < $1.key}  // or {$0.value < $1.value} to sort using the dictionary values
print(sorted) // "[(key: "name1", value: "Loy"), (key: "name2", value: "Roy"), (key: "name3", value: "Tim"), (key: "name4", value: "Steve")]\n"
for element in sorted {
print("Key = \(element.key) Value = \(element.value)" )
}
```

## Handle multiple OS targets

The last version I'm supporting is 10.13
XCode 9.3 works well for targeting SDK 10.13 and Swift 4.1
XCode 9.2 ...

- The kCGDisplayBeginConfigurationFlag flag is always set
> Cocoa already uses this notification mechanism to respond to display reconfigurations. As a result, when a user or application changes a display mode, turns on mirroring, or disconnects a display, Cocoa applications donâ€™t need to be concerned with repositioning or resizing their windows. The application frameworks handle this task automatically.

If you want to receive notifications of configuration changes, here is a brief description of the steps:
